# Tempo Day Templates & MCP Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Built

### 1. Day Template System
A prototypical day designer that allows users to create reusable day patterns - moving beyond rigid scheduling to meaningful life patterns.

**Key Features:**
- **Template Creation**: Design ideal days with activities, naming, and categorization
- **Drag & Drop**: Reorder activities within templates with smooth interactions  
- **Categories**: Organize templates (Creative, Productive, Rest, Social, etc.)
- **Storage**: Persistent localStorage with proper hooks architecture
- **Template Library**: Browse, search, edit, duplicate, and delete templates

### 2. Core Components Built

#### `DayTemplate.tsx`
- Clean canvas for designing prototypical days
- Activity management with drag & drop reordering
- Template metadata (name, description, category)
- Integration with existing ActivityEditor

#### `DayTemplateLibrary.tsx` 
- Grid-based template browser
- Search and filter capabilities
- Template actions (apply, edit, duplicate, delete)
- Empty states and responsive design

#### `useDayTemplates.ts` Hook
- Complete CRUD operations for templates
- localStorage persistence
- Template categorization and filtering
- Duplicate functionality with smart naming

### 3. MCP API Integration

#### API Endpoints
- `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/activities` - Complete activity management
- `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/day-templates` - Template CRUD operations  
- `POST /api/day-templates/apply` - Apply templates to calendar dates

#### MCP Server Configuration (`mcp-server.json`)
**Tools Available for AI Agents:**
- `get_activities` - Retrieve activities by date/range
- `create_activity` - Add new activities to specific dates
- `update_activity` - Modify existing activities
- `delete_activity` - Remove activities
- `get_day_templates` - Browse templates with filtering
- `create_day_template` - Generate new templates
- `apply_day_template` - Apply templates to calendar dates
- `delete_day_template` - Remove templates

**Resources:**
- `tempo://activities/{date}` - Daily activities
- `tempo://templates` - Template collection
- `tempo://week/{startDate}` - Weekly view

**AI Prompts:**
- `create_meaningful_day` - Help design days based on focus/energy
- `suggest_activities` - Activity recommendations by type

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Day Template Workflow
1. **Create**: Use `/tempo/day-template` to design an ideal day
2. **Save**: Templates stored with categories and metadata
3. **Browse**: Access via library in main calendar view  
4. **Apply**: Copy template activities to any calendar date
5. **Manage**: Edit, duplicate, or delete as needed

### MCP Integration
AI agents can now:
- Read user's current activities and templates
- Suggest improvements to daily planning
- Create new activities based on patterns
- Apply existing templates to upcoming dates
- Help optimize life enrichment patterns

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

**Template-First Approach**: Focus on creating meaningful day patterns rather than micro-scheduling. Templates represent "types of days" (Creative Sunday, Deep Work Day, Family Connection Day) that can be applied flexibly.

**Life Enrichment Focus**: Activities emphasize growth, connection, creativity, and enrichment rather than productivity metrics or task completion.

**Flexible Application**: Templates provide structure without rigid time constraints - focus on sequence and intention rather than exact scheduling.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
- `DayTemplate` interface extends storage capabilities
- Proper TypeScript throughout API and components
- Consistent error handling and validation

### Storage Architecture  
- `useDayTemplates` hook manages all template operations
- localStorage persistence with JSON serialization
- Atomic operations with proper error handling

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints following Next.js conventions
- Comprehensive input validation and error responses
- MCP-compatible structure for AI agent integration

### Component Architecture
- Reuses existing UI components (`ActivityBlock`, `ActivityEditor`)
- Consistent design patterns with calendar system
- Responsive design with mobile considerations

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- **Template Sharing**: Export/import templates between users
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered template recommendations
- **Template Analytics**: Track which templates lead to better outcomes
- **Seasonal Templates**: Templates that adapt to time of year/weather
- **Template Scheduling**: Automatically apply templates to recurring patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for AI Integration

The MCP server configuration makes Tempo accessible to AI agents for:
- Intelligent daily planning assistance
- Pattern recognition in user preferences  
- Proactive template suggestions
- Adaptive scheduling based on energy/context
- Life enrichment coaching through activity recommendations

This creates a foundation for AI-assisted life planning that respects Tempo's philosophy of meaningful, flexible time management.
