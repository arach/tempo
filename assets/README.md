# Assets

This directory contains screenshots and media assets for the Tempo project.

## Screenshots

- `tempo-calendar-preview.png` - Main calendar preview showing the weekly view with activities

To add the calendar preview screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the main Tempo calendar interface
2. Save it as `tempo-calendar-preview.png` in this directory
3. The README will automatically display it

The screenshot should ideally show:
- A week view with multiple days
- Various activity types (Enrichment, Connection, Growth, Creative)
- Activities stacked vertically in different days
- Clean, modern dark/light theme
- No personal information or sensitive data
